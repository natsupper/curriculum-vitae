Summary
-------

I am an **applied physicist** who has transitioned to the exciting world of
**data science**.

Over 15 years I drove many fundamental improvements in electronics hardware,
resulting in **20 patents, 15 publications** and an invitation to join the
**National Academy of Engineers**.

I did this largely by developing new ways to **explore testing data**, and with
the recent growth of **Big Data** I made the switch to focus on analytics full
time.

I use the tools of **machine learning** and **data science**, but I am also
keenly aware of how they tie back to the **real-world processes** that generate
the data and inform any **analysis**.
