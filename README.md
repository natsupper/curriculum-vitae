Summary
-------

I am an **applied physicist** who has transitioned to the exciting world of
**software test automation**.

Over 15 years I drove many fundamental improvements in electronics hardware,
resulting in **20 patents, 15 publications** and an invitation to join the
**National Academy of Engineers**.

I did this largely by developing new ways to **test and explore data**, and
with the recent growth of **cloud computing** I made the switch to focus on
testing software applications full time.

I develop and automate test scenarios that are modular and flexible to apply to
all our applications. This has improved our test coverage and efficiency by
100%.
